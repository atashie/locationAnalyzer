description: "A check that does not fail in the way the change can fail proves nothing - ast.parse was run against a missing-import risk, and a guard built from a loose substring match skipped silently instead of erroring"

Two failures in one afternoon, same cause, found by Codex pass 29
([[project-phase1-s3-step0-audit-harness]]).

I routed two spike builders through a writer so their rasters would carry an encoding stamp. The
patch script guarded the new import with `"layer import" not in s` — and that substring already
appeared in the file's existing `from locfinder.traveltime.layer import build_layer_seconds`. The
guard read False, the insertion was skipped, **no error was raised**, and the builder shipped calling
a function it had never imported. It would have crashed after saving new seconds and left the
previous raster in place: contradictory artifacts, worse than the unstamped output it replaced.

Then I verified the change with `ast.parse` on five files and reported "all parse". A missing name
parses perfectly. **The check could not fail in the way the change could fail**, so passing it said
nothing at all — and it read as diligence in the transcript, which is the part that makes this worth
recording.

**Why:** a verification step earns its place by being able to fail for the reason at hand. Syntax
checking a change whose risk is resolution, or asserting a substring is absent when a longer string
containing it is present, both produce a green signal that is unconnected to the thing being
established. The second is worse than no check, because a guard that silently skips leaves no trace
while an absent one at least leaves the work visibly undone.

**How to apply:**

- **Name the failure mode, then pick the check that exhibits it.** Missing import or typo'd name →
  `pyflakes` / `ruff --select F821`, or import the module. Wrong arithmetic → run it on the
  counterexample. Wrong file written → read the bytes back. Syntax is almost never the risk.
- **In a patch script, assert on the exact thing being added**, not on a loose proxy for it.
  `"from x import y" not in s` guards an insertion of `from x import y`; `"x import" not in s` guards
  nothing and matches by accident.
- **Prefer a guard that raises over one that skips.** The assertion-guarded patch pattern
  ([[project-phase1-s3-step0-audit-harness]]) works because a mismatch *stops* the script before
  `write_text`. A conditional that silently declines to act has the opposite property, and I used
  one for an insertion that mattered.
- `uv run --with pyflakes python -m pyflakes <dirs>` needs no project dependency and takes a second;
  it is now the check after any edit that moves or adds a name. `ruff` is not installed here.

Related: [[feedback-a-fixture-is-exact-only-where-you-point-it]], which is the same error one level
up — a test drawn from the wrong domain also passes without establishing anything. In this session
that one recurred too: the fixture "proving" an `OFF_NETWORK` bound drew access distances from
`[0, 200]` m, the range in which a cell is *not* off-network at all.
